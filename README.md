# Project Overview

This project aims to make complex multi-omics data (gene expression, mutation, and copy number variation) more accessible and insightful through data visualization. By applying advanced methods such as heatmaps and Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA), the visualizations help illustrate the distinct molecular profiles of cancer subtypes in colorectal cancer. These methods not only enhance data comprehension but also reveal underlying patterns that may not be evident in raw data alone. While the primary data files (.csv) and certain packages are not included here due to their large size, this README outlines the visualization approach and the code used to generate the analysis.
